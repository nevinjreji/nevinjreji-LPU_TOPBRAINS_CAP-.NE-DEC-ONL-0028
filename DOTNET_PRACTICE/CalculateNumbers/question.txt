## 3. Calculate Number – Developing C# Application

### Functionalities

In the code template, a public static `List<int>` named `NumberList` is already provided.

In the `Program` class, implement the following methods.

---

### Methods

```csharp
public void AddNumbers(int numbers)
public double GetGPAScored()
public char GetGradeScored(double gpa)
```

---

### Method Description

1. **AddNumbers(int numbers)**
   This method is used to add numbers to the `NumberList`.

   * The number is passed as an argument and should be added to the list.

2. **GetGPAScored()**
   This method is used to calculate the GPA of all numbers scored in the semester and return the value.

   * GPA is calculated based on the sum of products of each number available in the `NumberList` and the credit point for each subject, divided by the sum of credits.
   * **Note:** The credit point for each subject is commonly 3.

   **GPA Formula:**

   ```
   GPA = (Number1 × 3 + Number2 × 3 + ... + NumberN × 3) / (ListCount × 3)
   ```

   * If the list is empty, return `-1` and print **"No Numbers Available"** in the `Main` method.

3. **GetGradeScored(double gpa)**
   This method is used to find the grade for the given GPA and return the grade character.

   * If the GPA is less than 5 or greater than 10, return a null character and print **"Invalid GPA"** in the `Main` method.
